# Clockwise Commutator

To deconstruct the legs in a clockwise commutator model that starts at 0 and goes down, with $M$ being the number 
of polyphase legs and downsample factor and overbar indicating the clockwise model.

$$ \bar{p}_{\rho} \left( n \right) = h \left( n M - \rho \right) $$

$$ \bar{x}_{\rho} \left( n \right) = x \left( n M - \rho \right) $$
